# QR Code Component - Frontend Mentor Challenge

A responsive QR code component built as part of a Frontend Mentor challenge. This project demonstrates fundamental front-end development skills using HTML and CSS.

## üéØ What I Learned

### CSS Custom Properties (CSS Variables)

- **Organized Design System**: Implemented a comprehensive design system using CSS custom properties for colors, typography, and spacing
- **Maintainable Code**: Used variables like `--slate-900`, `--text-size-preset-1`, and `--spacing-500` to create consistent and easily maintainable styles
- **Scalable Architecture**: Structured variables in logical groups (colors, typography, spacing) for better organization

### Flexbox Layout

- **Centering Techniques**: Mastered both horizontal and vertical centering using `display: flex`, `align-items: center`, and `justify-content: center`
- **Responsive Design**: Created flexible layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
- **Container Management**: Used flexbox for both the main page layout and internal component structure

### Typography & Design Systems

- **Google Fonts Integration**: Imported and implemented the Outfit font family with multiple weights
- **Typography Hierarchy**: Created consistent text styling with predefined font sizes, line heights, and letter spacing
- **Design Tokens**: Translated design specifications into reusable CSS variables

### Semantic HTML

- **Accessibility**: Used semantic HTML elements like `<main>` for better screen reader support
- **Proper Structure**: Organized content with meaningful HTML structure and appropriate alt text for images
- **Clean Markup**: Maintained clean, readable HTML without unnecessary div elements

### CSS Box Model & Styling

- **Border Radius**: Applied consistent border radius for modern, rounded corners
- **Spacing System**: Implemented a systematic approach to margins and padding using predefined spacing variables
- **Color Management**: Used a limited, purposeful color palette with semantic naming

### Project Organization

- **File Structure**: Organized CSS in a separate file for better maintainability
- **Asset Management**: Properly structured images and favicon files
- **Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation and style guides
